<h1>Who Is Carly Kauer?</h1>
<p>
Well, that one's easy! Carly Kauer is an independant game developer and graphic artist based in Kaysville Utah, co-owner of Gaedium, and web developer! 
She's worked on projects like Crime Soup and Miller Hook, video games being developed under Gaedium. She's also the
sole character artist, storyboard artist, and animator working on Gaedium's short film 'Little Boy'. On top of all
of that, she's a freelance artist and writer and excells in digital art, sculpting, animation, needle felting, painting, storywriting, you name it!
<br>Carly was born and raised in Utah, and lived her early years in little ol' West Haven! She grew up alongside her twin sister Taylor Kauer, 
her little brother, and then-- much to everyone's surprise-- a second set of twin sisters! Her family and friends have been a major influence on 
her life. She loves fishing, writing, reading, and tending to her animals and her extensive (perhaps <i>too</i> extensive) plant collection!</br>
